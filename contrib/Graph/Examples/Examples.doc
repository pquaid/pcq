    As expained in "ReadMe" GRAPH is very easy to use.
    Simply "AttachGraph" and "InitGraph" and after that what you want.

    However, an example always makes it easier to understand the theory.
    Therefore I have written two silly ones which demonstrate how to use
    the various GRAPH.LIB routines and two simple applications which
    should give you an idea how to make sensible programs using GRAPH.

    The silly ones:
	- GraphTest:
	    Just a collection of the most general GRAPH routines.
	    A silly picture is draw by using them.

	- PageTest:
	    A demonstration of the page-stuff. Shows how to "AppPage"
	    and "RemPage" and how to select pages as visible or active.


    The applications:
	- Lorenz:
	    Shows how to create high-quality hardcopies.
	    It draws the Lorenz-Attractor and after that prints the
	    display.

	- M_J_sets:
	    Renders Mandelbrot- and Julia-sets.
