                               Guru V1.00
                        A custom Alert() Conjurer
                      By Chris Pressey (Cat's Eye)

WHAT IT IS:

	Guru V1.00

WHAT IT DOES:

	Shows an Alert() (those funky red flashing Guru boxes at the top
	of the screen) and waits for one of the mouse buttons to be pressed.
	Sets the condition flag accordingly (see below.)

SYNOPSIS:

	Guru "string"

	Where "string" is the string you wish to be displayed in the
	Alert() (in double quotes.)

	Do try to limit the string to less than 80 characters or you may
	get some unexpected results.

EXAMPLE:

	Guru "Are you SURE ? (Left button Yes, Right button No)"

WHY I DID THIS:

	It's prettier (?) than the C: command "ASK" and does basically the
	same thing. If the user presses the left button, it returns a flag
	of 5 (WARN), otherwise (if the user presses the right button) it
	returns 0 (OK.) I also find that Alerts() tend to scare jumpy Amiga
	programmers! :)

ENVIRONMENT:

	Guru was programmed in PCQ Pascal, by Pat Quaid.
