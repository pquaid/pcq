                                LED V1.0
                        A very silly little hack
                            By Chris Pressey

WHAT IT IS:

	LED V1.0

WHAT IT DOES:

	Changes the status of the power Light-Emitting Diode on the Amiga
	computer. This also controls the audio filter; when the LED is off,
	the audio output is unfiltered.

SYNOPSIS:

	LED <number>

	Where <number> is either 1 or 0, 1 dictating ON and 0 dictating OFF.

EXAMPLE:

	LED 0

WHY I DID THIS:

	I have no idea. I was bored tonight. Yes that's right, I have done
	this all in one night! A possible could be : you have left your
	Amiga on all day to raytrace a picture or something, and gone off
	to school, and you don't want your parents to know that your Amiga
	is on as then they will make you pay a higher percentage of the
	electricity bill!

ENVIRONMENT:

	LED was programmed in PCQ Pascal, by Pat Quaid.
