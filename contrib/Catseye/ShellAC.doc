                       A Shell or CLI window mutilator
                        By Chris Pressey (Cat's Eye)

WHAT IT IS:

	ShellAC V1.01

WHAT IT DOES:

	Changes your Shell or CLI window's colours and window limits, if
	run from the Shell or CLI (the only recomended environment.)

SYNOPSIS:

	ShellAC <colour 1><colour 2>
	
	Where :
	colour 1 is the BlockPen of the window
	colour 2 is the DetailPen

	Make sure there is no space between the two digits.

	ShellAC automatically destroys the window limits, which I find
	handy because I like to resize my windows into nothingness in the
	upper left hand corner.

EXAMPLE:

	ShellAC 01 resets the window colours to normal.
	ShellAC 00 makes the window nearly invisible.
	Etc...

WHY I DID THIS:

	I like to play with other people's windows!

HOW IT WORKS:

	It opens a small window on the workbench screen, and gets the
	window's parent (W^.Parent) and changes that window. That's why you
	could get unexpected results if run from the workbench.

	ShellAC was programmed in PCQ Pascal, by Pat Quaid.
