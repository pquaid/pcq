                        A PCQ sourcecode mangler
                      By Chris Pressey (Cat's Eye)

WHAT IT IS:

	PCQMangle V0.90b

WHAT IT DOES:

	For now, PCQMangle takes the source of any PCQ Pascal file and
	will coalesce all it's Include statements {$I "file"}. In the
	future, the program will be expanded to :

		o De-comment source code in Pascal.
		o Gather up the Procedure and Function headers
			(handy for making .i files)

SYNOPSIS:

	PCQMangle

	You will be prompted for the input and output filenames.

EXAMPLE:

	PCQMangle
	
	system.p
	T:system_mangled.p

WHY I DID THIS:

	I have written a few programs which are comprised of a lot of
	Include files. Before I wrote this, the only eay way to print them
	out was to load each into my text editor, format them, and print
	them seperately. Now I can join them in the order they appear.

ENVIRONMENT:

	PCQMangle was programmed in PCQ Pascal, by Pat Quaid.
