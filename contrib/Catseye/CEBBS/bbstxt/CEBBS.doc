                               CEBBS V1.11
                        A BBS jury-rigged in PCQ
                      By Chris Pressey (Cat's Eye)
             With loads of help and stuff from Kerry Paulson


WHAT IT IS:

	CEBBS V1.11 (executable : BBS)

WHAT IT DOES:

	Runs a bulletin board system on the Amiga. As of this "release" it
	is still somewhat customized to my system (modem, HD) and is a !@#$%
	to change, but it's being worked on.

SYNOPSIS:

	CLI :

	BBS {L}

	Command Line Options :

	none	will evoke the BBS, allowing it to answer external calls

	L	will evoke the BBS in local mode. Someone must actually be
		on the local console to do anything.


	WorkBench :

	Double-click BBS icon (runs as "none" above)


WHY I DID THIS:

	I didn't want to set up yet another BBS software system that's
	already been overused, like Paragon, etc, ETC. So I decided I was
	mentally ill enough to tackle the job of writing my own. I found
	out that I was mostly right - except for the occasional crash,
	CEBBS, if NOTHING else, works.

ENVIRONMENT:

	CEBBS was programmed in PCQ Pascal, by Patrick Quaid. This version
	is in 1.2b, but I do plan to register PCQ and hopefully future
	versions will be easier to compile...

SETUP ENVIRONMENT:

	Well, it works with MY system. (1 down, 83 thousand to go... ;)
	My system consists of :

		Amiga 500
		Avatex 2400 modem (external)
		Trumpcard 500
		49M Seagate HD
		1 external floppy drive
		1084 (This REALLY matters! ;)

	Before the advent of my HD, CEBBS _did_ run off of the floppies.
	However, I would not suggest this setup, as it is slow, and does
	take quite a bit of space... but it might still work.

	As for modem - as far as I know, one that will auto-answer, and
	send you different strings according to what baud rate you connected
	at, should work fine. (IE, if you have an AA'ing Hayes, Bob's
	your uncle.) I had to junk my GVC SuperModem recently as it would
	not answer 1200 baud callers. But that has nothing to do with the
	BBS (I'm 99.99% sure.) As of this 'release,' CEBBS ONLY uses the
	serial port. So if you have an internal modem, you're SOL.

	As for running on a 2000, 3000, 1000... who knows?

HISTORY:

v1.00	Original set up; really, really icky. Ancient history.
v1.01	Mostly bug fixes. Changed the menu handler and added MGB.
v1.02	Mail handled better, more menus, word wrap in chat.
v1.03	Modem interface handled better. (?!) I now read strings in instead
	of single characters (ie, "1" for "1200".) However, either my
	BBS or my modem is chopping off the first letter. So the set up is
	now for it to answer on "ONNECT". :>
v1.09	Bugs fixed; less global variables (because they are brainwashing us
	that they are dangerous in my compsci class). Added flags to
	ReadString : however, there may be bugs (How very odd. ;)
	But you can now get string that theoretically echo back
	only uppercase (eg, for handles a la SearchLight.)
	Also added Intuition menus (although "About" won't get you anything),
	the ability to embed ANSI codes in text (^P##, this will be expanded
	in the future).
v1.09b	OK, I don't know WHY, but now it's sending "CONNECT"... I added
	some menial baud rate stuff, maybe that's what did it?!?!
v1.1	Contains Kerry Paulson's SList as a procedure for much (?)
	cleaner execution of directories. Also has some more stuff jammed
	into it; the userlister is now internal, for example. This is
	incredibly bad timing for a leap to version number 1.1; actually
	very few things are resolved.
v1.1a	_Should_ handle loss of carrier more eloquently (ie crash less)
	Cohesive lines in MGB, so that 40-column messages will look 80
	columns when viewed by a person with 80.
	Added 'Edit' command to MGB.
v1.1b	BUG! Maybe my modem got fried because of power surges today (I hate
	Manitoba winters!) but it certainly seems to not want to talk to
	the computer. Actually Jr-Comm, YES, CEBBS, NO. So maybe not.
	Working on it before the actualy release of the next release.
v1.1c   Guess what folks? We're back to ONNECT...
v1.1d   Actually, we're back to either CONNECT or ONNECT. Looks like there
	aren't any garbled messes yet though (a good sign.) I _think_ I've
	changed SetBaud to just pay attention to the last 4 characters of
	what it reads in (so we really don't have to deal with a C, or no
	C) There is a new bug popping up now - (R)eplying privately...
v1.11	First copyrighted version. Added 'Insert Line' and 'Delete Line' to
	MGB. Changed the mail so that it _should_ prompt you if you want
	to read the mail you've been sent. Also fixed a small bug if someone
	drops carrier on the login screen.

PLANS:

	...should add :

	* NON-busy wait()ing.

	* INPUT BUFFER - for macros and the like.

	Event-based time limits (ie. an event, such as your time
	running out, or FIDO-only hours, kicks you off the board)

	Make the @-command scripting pretty extensive, and document it
	fully.

	A better way to do CD and TR (insensitive of .device; right now,
	CEBBS will ONLY use the serial.device)

	An option for read/new scan

	More editing commands for MGB (Fix typo)

	Place the Voting questions in a message base, using @ scripts.

	Not only have voting questions, but also : quiz (variant of voting
	question), "petition" (just something users can put their name on
	to let everyone know that they belong in that group)

	A tap return prompt after "lines" number of lines have been sent
	in send_file

	A way to handle files (if not download them!)

	A CLI sometime (can't be too hard) : would like to
	contain something similar to :

	help			{ read help file }
	go #			{ go to message number }
	head			{ go to start of messages }
	tail			{ go to end of messages }
	next			{ next message }
	back			{ previous message }
	reply			{ reply to this message }
	enter			{ enter a message }
	send			{ send a message you have entered }
	post			{ post a message }
	jump <branch>		{ jump to different branch }
	read #			{ read text file }
	list <TEXT|FILES>	{ list textfiles/files }
	mail <user>		{ ? }
	menu			{ gobacktoa menus }
	bye			{ log off }
	down <TEXT|FILES> <#/name>	{ download textfile/file }
	up <name>		{ upload file }
	users			{ read user list }
	page			
	deny
	quiet
	listen
	crumple
	thread
	unthread
	proto <choice>
	ansi <choice>
	password <choice>
