Welcome to Windaria BBS. The Rules :

    1. Handles are OK. However, you must also leave your real name and
some real information about yourself. Anyone found leaving a false
name/information will be booted.

    2. Sysops and cosysops can sneak into all the 'private' stuff on
this BBS (ie mail) but we SWEAR WE WON'T unless such action is warranted.

    3. Keep profanity to a minimum.

    4. Try to stay out of fights, esPECIALLY if it's about someone's
spelling or grammar; I'm sick of going around saying "Guys, break it up."
I supose I can't stop you from fighting, but as Josh says,
"Be excellent to each other." OK? Good. Also, anyone found directly
insulting anyone else will be demoted. (ie. "You're an asshole," or even
"Joe User is a jerk.")
