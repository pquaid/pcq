You are now a member of this BBS. However, you are only a Recruit. You will have limited access until Cat's Eye or Schrapnel decides to validate you, and then you will become a Pte. (Private, as in the military rank, NOT as in opposite of public!)

You will be asked to leave a little feedback about yourself; you needn't go into much detail, We just need to know who are you and that you'd like to be validated. (But do feel free to babble if you so please!)

Enjoy Windaria!
