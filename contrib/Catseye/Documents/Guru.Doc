WHAT IT IS
¯¯¯¯ ¯¯ ¯¯
A program written in PCQ Pascal 1.1d to give the user an Alert,
to, well, alert him/her to something. Useful, especially in
a script file.

WHY IT IS
¯¯¯ ¯¯ ¯¯
Something to do.

USAGE:
¯¯¯¯¯
	Guru "string" [-r]

	"String" is the string you want displayed in the Alert().
	Limit it to under 80 characters or you'll get some pretty
	funky results.

	Switch : -r
	If you use this, it will actually reset the Amiga. Use this
	only if you are feeling sadistic or in an emergency.

EXAMPLE USAGE:
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ ¯¯¯¯¯
	Guru "There's always one more bug"

	Guru is actually more useful in a script, such as...
	.
	.
	FailAt 20 (or lower)
	Guru "Do you want to be insulted? (Left button Yes, Right button No)"
	If Fail
	    Guru "Alright, I won't insult you"
	Else
	    Guru "You are an absolute yutz"
	EndIf
	.
	.
	The possibilities are endless...
NB
¯¯
Left button is affirmative - it exits at 0, while the negative right
button exits at 20.
