ShellAC V1.0 by Chris Pressey (Cat'sEye)
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ ¯¯¯¯ ¯¯ ¯¯¯¯¯ ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
WHAT IT IS
¯¯¯¯ ¯¯ ¯¯
A program written in PCQ Pascal 1.1d to allow me and everyone else
to screw around with Shell and CLI windows.

WHY IT IS
¯¯¯ ¯¯ ¯¯
Something to do. I like nonconformist Shell windows.

USAGE:
¯¯¯¯¯
	ShellAC <BlockPen> <DetailPen> [t "stringwin" "stringscr"] [h/x]

	<blockpen> : Colour for drawing the Shell window's borders

	<detailpen> : Colour for drawing the Shell window's details

	Option : t

	Change the titles of the window and screen. NB due
	to my strange programming practices you lose some
	memory permanently that way. I don't really care. If
	you do, fix it and tell me about it.

	"Stringwin" is the string you want displayed in the
	window's drag bar.

	"Stringscr" is the string you want displayed in the
	screen's drag bar when the window is active.

	Option : h/x

	Use one of these only. h will hide the window (change it's size
	to (1,1) and put it in the upper left corner. x will expand the
	window from that to the full screen.

EXAMPLE USAGE:
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ ¯¯¯¯¯
	ShellAC 3 0

	Changes just the colours.

	ShellAC 1 2 h

	Hides the window.

	ShellAC 1 3 t "The Shell From Hell" "The Shell From Hell Rules!" x

	Expands the window and changes it's titles.

NB
¯¯
I use a really innovative and VERY HACKY method to get the address of
the Shell/CLI window.
