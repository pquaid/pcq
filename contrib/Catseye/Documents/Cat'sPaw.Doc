Cat'sPaw V1.02 by Chris Pressey (Cat'sEye)
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ ¯¯¯¯¯ ¯¯ ¯¯¯¯¯ ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
WHAT IT IS
¯¯¯¯ ¯¯ ¯¯
A program written in PCQ Pascal 1.1d, to give you a gadget-based
multipurpose menu selection control, used in, say, a script file,
or the startup-sequence.

WHY IT IS
¯¯¯ ¯¯ ¯¯
I wrote this because I have a few utility disks full of similar
programs (eg FixDisk, DiskSalv, DiskX) that I really don't like
to run from Workbench. In my S:Startup-Sequence I use a loop like
this :

	lab here
		Cat'sPaw S:Cat'spaw.conf -s
	skip here back

By the way, a cat's-paw, in Brit slang, is "a person used as a
tool or dupe." Fitting?

USAGE:
¯¯¯¯¯
	Cat'sPaw "configuration file" [-b] [-s]

Takes it's input from the file until it finds "end"
and a blank line. The configuration file
should look like:

	Title for the selection menu
	Displayed name for first gadget
	Executed name for first gadget
	Displayed name for second gadget
	Executed name for second gadget
	etc...
	end
	(blank line)

Special commands:
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
	Command Line :
	¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ ¯¯¯¯
	-b switch
	will put Cat'sPaw in 'boring' mode, ie no
bouncy balls, but multitasking improves +++.

	-s switch
	forces Cat'sPaw to open a new screen for it's
windows. Normally it appears over all the other windows
on the Workbench screen, which may be inconvenient.

	In Configuration File:
	¯¯ ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ ¯¯¯¯
	Name of More gadget
	»more
	will create a new page of gadgets, so that
	you can have more than you can fit on one screen.
	Five pages are available, 40 gadgets maximum (in total.)
	note that you need a »more on each page you
	create if you have > 1.

	Name of About gadget
	»about
	will invoke the "About" routine.

	Name of Quit Gadget
	»quit
	will end Cat'sPaw without executing anything.

	Name of Requester Gadget
	»req
	will open up a File Reqeuster and execute what you choose.
	____________________________
	Warning! »req does not work!
	¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
	Name of Wait Gadget
	»wait
	will cause Cat'sPaw to non-busy wait until you
	click a gadget. Helps multitasking immensely,
	especially in the circumstances in which I set up
	Cat'sPaw on one of my disks. (Everything was RUNBACKed)

EXAMPLE USAGE:
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ ¯¯¯¯¯
	cd PCQUtils:PCQUtils/Compiled
	CatsPaw PCQUtils:PCQUtils/Scripts/CatsPaw.conf
