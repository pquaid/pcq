PCQUtils V1.0 by Cat'sEye		March 31st, AD 1991
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ ¯¯¯¯
WHAT THEY ARE
¯¯¯¯ ¯¯¯¯ ¯¯¯
Various programs (compiled versions, no source) written in PCQ Pascal
V1.1d by me. This also includes the source for the external files that
make up my custom linker .lib, CE.lib. And scripts for 'make' and
'makelib' And a picture to test CEView with. Just loads of stuff.

CAUTIONARY WARNING
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
My theory is that the more you test something, the more bugs it gets.
Therefore the routines in CE.lib are not all tested. I haven't tested
the ListDir() things in DOSStuff.x. However, I will and report on their
use next release. The stuff with the proportional gadgets is now beyond me.
Maybe. I don't know. In the next few weeks I will try to catch up with it.

Also, pardon my spartan use of comments. Some functions just seem too
straightforward to bother to type up a whole paragraph on them. If
you're as skilled as you think you are, you can figure them out.

As I'm constantly debugging and making these routines more efficient,
they are constantly getting antiquated. See below for how to get the
source for the examples. Don't worry, I'll include the source in the next
release (I hope.)

WHO I AM
¯¯¯ ¯ ¯¯
If you want to write to me :

	Cat'sEye
	917 Wicklow Place
	Winnipeg, MB (Canada)
	R3T 0J1

You can get the newest source from me if you send a 3½ to me and I feel
like sending it back. Canadians should send a SASE to get on my good
side. (No, I'm really more jovial than this. Ha ha ha.)

If you want to write me a cheque, use Chris Pressey. I don't like to
fiddle with aliases when it comes to money. Not like you have to
write me a cheque, but just a thought.

No, I do not, of this writing have a modem. Well, OK, I have a modem
but I still need a modem cable and about 6 metres of phone cable to
get it hopping. I should be on some 'nets by next release.

DESIGNATION
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Public Domain. Share and Enjoy, you hoopy froods. However, I do request
that if use any of these things for commercial uses that you give
credit where credit is due (IE Cat'sEye, yup, that's me.)
