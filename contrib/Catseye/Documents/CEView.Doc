CEView V1.0 by Chris Pressey (Cat'sEye)

WHAT IT IS
¯¯¯¯ ¯¯ ¯¯
A program written in PCQ Pascal 1.1d to display IFF ILBM pictures.
Not useful in itself, because the PD market is already overloaded
with picture viewers. It's just an example of how to use my graphics
routines to load ILBMs in Pascal.

WHY IT IS
¯¯¯ ¯¯ ¯¯
Testing my theory that you can do anything if you have enough
routines in your linker .lib (In my case, CE.lib)

USAGE:
¯¯¯¯¯
	CEView "picture file"

	Pretty straightforward, huh? Thought so.

EXAMPLE USAGE:
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ ¯¯¯¯¯
	cd PCQUtils:PCQUtils/Compiled
	CEView PCQUtils:PCQUtils/Pics/AmigaMascot

CREDITS
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
This was derived, very indirectly, from my old View.p, which
was in turn derived from a program called

	VIEW.C - tiny ILBM viewer (c) 1986 DJH

I believe DJH is John Hodgson. His address :
