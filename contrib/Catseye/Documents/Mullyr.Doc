MulLyr V1.0 by Chris Pressey (Cat'sEye)
¯¯¯¯¯¯ ¯¯¯¯ ¯¯ ¯¯¯¯¯ ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
WHAT IT IS
¯¯¯¯ ¯¯ ¯¯
A program written in PCQ Pascal 1.1d to execute a mathematical
model. This particular model is designed to predict an illusion:
how long a line looks in the case:

				<-->
				>--<	Which line is bigger?

Okay, so the ordinary Amiga Joe isn't going to benefit from
this program. I have just included it as a demonstration of
how professional you can make programs written in Pascal
look. The program was written for my father's research in
visual perception.

WHY IT IS
¯¯¯ ¯¯ ¯¯
To get money from my father, and an example of IntuiStuff.

USAGE:
¯¯¯¯¯
	MulLyr (or click on icon)

	Pretty straightforward, huh? Thought so.

CREDITS
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
This was derived, very indirectly, from an Apple ][ program called
Prediction which I collaborated on with Bernd Kersten.
