## Contrib

When I was developing PCQ Pascal, just prior to the Internet
becoming popular, I had an active correspondence with lots of
fellow Amiga programmers. This correspondence was largely through
the mail, and occasionally through a BBS.

Among other things, people used to send me interesting programs
they had written in PCQ Pascal. This directory includes a few
of those projects.
