 *  a GEL to describe whether or not these types of collisions
 *  can affect the GEL.	 BNDRY_HIT is described further below;
 *  this bit is permanently assigned as the boundary-hit flag.
 *  The other bit GEL_HIT is meant only as a default to cover
 *  any GEL hitting any other; the user may redefine this bit.

 *  set by a call to SetCollision) the first argument passed to
 *  the user's routine is the address of the GEL involved in the
 *  boundry-hit, and the second argument has the appropriate bit(s)
 *  set to describe which boundry was surpassed
