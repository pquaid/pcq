This is PCQ Pascal, a compiler I wrote in the late 1980s. Included here
is the source for the compiler, the runtime library, include files, and
various utilities like a peephole optimizer and a simple 'make' utility.

I fired up my 25-year-old Amiga and copied these files off. I've posted
them exactly as they were, except that I changed several files called
foo.DOC to foo.txt. In particular, that means that the docs still refer
to shareware and a copyright. I have no remaining interest in these
files, but neither do I have time to add a proper open source
license and remove any restrictions mentioned in these files. If
you can use any of this for anything, have at it.
